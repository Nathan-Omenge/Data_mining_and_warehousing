# Data Mining and Warehousing Environment Setup

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that sets up a Python environment for **Data Mining and Warehousing** tasks. The notebook walks through testing the Python installation, installing required libraries, and creating a simple data warehouse example using **SQLite**, **Pandas**, and **Matplotlib/Seaborn**.

---

## Notebook Contents

The notebook is divided into the following sections:

### 1. Hello World
- A simple check to confirm that the Python environment and Jupyter Notebook are working.

### 2. Environment Testing
- Check the Python version and system information (`sys`, `platform`).
- Verify availability of essential libraries:
  - **NumPy**
  - **Pandas**
  - **Matplotlib**
  - **SciPy**
  - **Seaborn**

### 3. Library Installation
- Demonstrates how to install missing libraries using `pip`.
- Verifies installation by printing library versions.

### 4. Database Setup
- Uses **SQLite** to create a local database file (`data_warehouse.db`).
- Functions included:
  - `create_connection()` → Connect to SQLite database.
  - `execute_query()` → Run SQL queries.
  - `fetch_data()` → Retrieve query results.
  - `create_table_from_df()` → Create tables from Pandas DataFrames.
  - `visualize_data()` → Visualize data using bar, line, or scatter plots.
  - `basic_data_analysis()` → Perform basic analysis (`head`, `info`, `describe`, missing values).

### 5. Example Data Warehouse Workflow
- Creates a sample employee dataset (`id`, `name`, `age`, `salary`).
- Stores the data in a SQLite database.
- Fetches and prints stored records.
- Performs exploratory data analysis (EDA).
- Visualizes employee salaries with a bar chart.

##  Requirements

- **Python version**: 3.8+ (tested on 3.12.0)
- **Jupyter Notebook / JupyterLab**
- Libraries:
  ```bash
  pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scipy

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open the notebook in Jupyter:
```
jupyter notebook "Data Mining and Warehousing Environment Setup.ipynb"

```

3.Run each cell step by step:
 * Verify your environment.
 * Install any missing libraries.
 * Execute the SQLite demo.
